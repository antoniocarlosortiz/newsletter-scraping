Recording my journey on learning webscraping

* On the email scraping folder, the script shows how to obtain info on emails using the IMAP4 module of Python.

* The exercises folder is just filled with web scrapoing tests I've done just so I could get a feel on how it works. This includes scraping of the NBA website for the most recent game stats of the cavs and the scraping of all the pictures of the webcomic Im fond of.
